# SOLVE-IT (a Systematic Objective-based Listing of Various Established digital Investigation Techniques)

## Introduction
Inspired by [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/), this repository contains a community project to map the objectives (tactics) and techniques that can be used as part of a digital forensic investigation.

The SOLVE-IT knowledge base was introduced at [DFRWS EU 2025](https://dfrws.org/presentation/solve-it-a-proposed-digital-forensic-knowledge-base-inspired-by-mitre-attck/). The associated academic paper in [FSI:Digital Investigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666281725000034) can be cited as:

A repository of examples can be found [here](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it-examples), and a dedicated repository using SOLVE-IT to consider applications of AI to digital forensics can be found [here](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it-applications-ai-review)


## Viewing the knowledge base
The high-level concepts are:

**Objectives**: based on ATT&CK tactics, objectives are "the goal that one might wish to achieve in a digital forensic investigation", e.g. acquire data, or extract information from a file system.

**Techniques**: "how one might achieve an objective in digital forensics by performing an action", e.g. for the objective of 'acquire data', the technique 'create disk image' could be used.

**Potential Weaknesses**: these represent potential problems resulting from using a technique. They are classified according to the error categories in ASTM E3016-18, the Standard Guide for Establishing Confidence in Digital and Multimedia Evidence Forensic Results by Error Mitigation Analysis.

**Mitigations**: something that can be done to prevent a weakness from occurring, or to minimise its impact.


Each of these concepts are contained in subfolders within the \data subfolder. Each technqiue, weakness, and mitigation is represented as a json file that can be directly viewed.

## Viewing the knowledge base in a spreadsheet

A utility script is provided, `reporting_scripts/generate_excel_from_kb.py`. This python3 script will generate an Excel spreadsheet (solve-it.xlsx) based on the current version of the json data (using the solve-it.json categorisations). This uses the Python xlsxwriter package. 

Pre-generated xlsx files can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it/releases) section, published at regular intervals. The most up-to-date version can be found [here](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it/blob/main/.repo_info/solve-it-latest.xlsx), which is auto-generated on each commit.

A another utility script `reporting_scripts/generate_evaluation.py` can be used with a list of technique IDs provided as command line arguments. This provides a repackaged checklist of the supplied technqiues, with their weaknesses and potential mitigations. This can be used to review a case, an SOP, a tool workflow, and more. See example in [SOLVE-IT examples repository](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it-examples/tree/main/forensic_workflow_example_forensic_imaging).

## Organisation of the techniques
The file `solve-it.json` is the default categorisation of the techniques, but other examples are provided in `carrier.json` and `dfrws.json`.
