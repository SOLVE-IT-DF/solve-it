# SOLVE-IT Style Guide




## General
* **Spelling**: US English is used throughout.
  
  
## Style Guide for Objectives

* **Top-level organisation**: Objectives are the top-level grouping of techniques within SOLVE-IT.  

### **Objective names**

* Use **sentence case** — capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.  
  	Example: Find potential digital evidence sources  
* Begin with a **present-tense imperative verb** (e.g., “Locate”, “Acquire”, “Preserve”).

### **Descriptions**

* Full sentences ending with a full stop.  
* Prefer **one sentence**, maximum **two sentences** (≤ 25 words).  
* Use **active voice** and keep grammatical structure consistent across all objectives.  
  * e.g. “Collect data from identified evidence sources.”  rather than “Data is collected from the identified evidence sources”.  
  * “Attempt to…” is permitted where there is uncertainty of success.  
* Use the Oxford comma for lists

### **Objective name and description “Investigator test”**

* All objectives must pass the “investigator test”:  
   “As an investigator, I want to \[objective name\]…” must make sense when read aloud.
