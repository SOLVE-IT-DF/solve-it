This an experimental systematic approach for enumerating weaknesses and mitigations for a technique. 

TRWM is the approach that systematically reviews in turn the Technique, the technique Results, the Weaknesses, then the Mitigations. TRWM-A is the version of this method that uses ASTM E3016-18 error classifications to assist with weakness enumeration. 

SHWAMA worksheets (SOLVE-IT Helper for Weakness And Mitigation Analysis) is a Google Sheet template that walks through the TRWM process with prompts, placeholder text, and linked worksheets that result in a summary sheet that can be used to implement the technique, weakness and mitigation content within the knowledge base.

An exercise on using the TRWM method and SHWAMA worksheets is available [in the SOLVE-IT education repository](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it-education). 

The latest SHWAMA worksheet template is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DRHCP7zAHBfz2TZ8yf3fhcc-bRZD25BT2oUAo1ZN6R4), which can be duplicated and used to work through the technique being studied.
